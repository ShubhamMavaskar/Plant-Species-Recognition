"Plant-Species-Recognition" This project is a comparison study to find the best way to classify the plant species.

Link to Download the Dataset used for this project:
Flavia Leafset : "https://flavia.sourceforge.net/"

To Run this file you need to train the models mentioned below. 
This File contains :

CNN1.ipynb : This file contains the application of CNN model to predict the class of the image.

CNN2.ipynb : This file contains the application of Xception model to predict the class of the image.

Concatenated model.ipynb : This file contains the application of concatenated model of both the CNN and Xception model to predict the class of the image.

Leaf_Classification.ipynb: This file contains the application of SVM classifier to predict the class of the image.

Random forest.ipynb : This file contains the application of Random Forest classifier to predict the class of the image.

Creating_Flavia_features.ipynb: This file contains feature extraction process and creates Flavia_features.csv file which stores the extracted features.

Feature extration of leaf.ipynb: This file shows how feature is extracted from a particular (single)image to generate the Flavia_feature dataset.

Split Folder.ipynb : In this file I have tried to apply CNN by using API but failed.
